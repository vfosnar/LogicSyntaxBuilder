# LogicSyntaxBuilder
 This is repository for my project of building a computer, simulated using a game called Scrap Mechanic
## Progress
 This computer is still in progress of building and it doesn't even work if you are reading this text. Gonna write update notes here later.
## How-to build
    git clone https://github.com/vfosnar/LogicSyntaxBuilder.git
    cd LogicSyntaxBuilder
    
    # this will build the whole project and export it to blueprints directory.
    # You need to restart steam after it if you are running this code for the first time
    bash build.sh /path/to/Scrap/Mechanic/Blueprints/some_uuid4/
